# Historcle

This game is like [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), but you guess a historical figure. For each guess, I will tell
you how far away they were born, in km and years, and any commonalities they shared.

Here is an example game.

| Guess number      | Guess | Distance (km)| time difference (years) | hints|
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------| -------- | -------|
| 1      | Samuel Adams       |775| 142| Harvard University Alumni|
| 2   | Rowan Atkinson        |	5543|81| Writer| 
| 2   | George Washington        |	653|142| Politician|
