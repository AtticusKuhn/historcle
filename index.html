    <h1>Historcle: A History Guessing Game</h1>
    <p>I have thought of a secret historical figure. Can you guess him? For each guess I will tell you
      how many years apart the two figures were born, and how far away they were born.
      Please note that as I am pulling these figures from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>,you must be
      precise
      in your spelling, i.e. "LeBron James" matches but not "Lebron James". The "hints" are commonalities
      between the two people. For example, if both your guess and my secret person were writers, then
      "writer" will appear as a hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      This game is just like wordle, in that there will be a new secret historical figure to guess each
      day. Right now we are on day
      <span id="day"></span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, this game is quite challenging because there are very many historical figures (at least 1000),
      so if you need to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> to cheat that's ok.
